## Basic information
 - The game has low poly aesthethics 
 - Apart from the model of the planet that was made entirely in Blender and cave interior which was modelled using Unity Terrain editor and "low-polyfied" using terrain .obj exporter from this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeS8dLgGIk)
 - Rest of the models are freely accessible from Unity Asset store:

## Main scene
The main environment of the game is a planet. As planets are spherical in nature the main scene also respects it. The player has the freedom of moving to each site from any point. The planet has life-unfriendly environment there is little to almost none vegetation. The only inhabitants are life-threatening spiders and few humanoid inhabitants that barely go to the surface of the planet. Other scenes (such as cave, spaceship, laboratory) are accessible from the planet.

## Abandoned laboratory
The laboratory is accessible from the dark side of the planet. The laboratory was presumably abandoned in a hurry and interior of the lab only confirms it. The furniture and equipment is in disarray as if the place was ransacked.

## Cave
Planet has a vast caves system. Few of them are inhabitated by humanoid creatures but are not accessible by the player. However, the player is able to access one of the caves. Cave entrances are visable on the planets surface.

## Spaceship
This scene is the interior of the spaceship in which the main player landed on the planet. It contains advanced equipment that every spaceship has.
